THE DEVELOPER’S WEBSITES MAY INCLUDE TECHNICAL OR OTHER MISTAKES, INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. DEVELOPER MAY MAKE CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.
5. Limitation of Liability.
You shall, at your own expense, indemnify, defend and hold Developer harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages, liabilities and expenses to the extent such claim arises out of: (a) any breach of this Agreement, (b) any claims or allegations made in connection with your use of a third party payment mechanism, © any breach or alleged breach of any representations and warranties made by a third party concerning any aspect of a Product, including but not limited to compatibility, (d) any claims made by or on behalf of any third party pertaining directly or indirectly to Your use of a Product, (e) any alleged or actual violation of your privacy or other rights by a third party, and (f) any allegations based on a product liability claim.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, (A) IN NO EVENT WILL DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS AND COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EVEN IF DEVELOPER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND (B) DEVELOPER’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF USD $50 OR THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY DEVELOPER IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. You acknowledge that the fees and amounts payable set forth in this Agreement reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Agreement and that the other party would not enter into this Agreement without these limitations on its liability. Each party agrees that these limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. The foregoing limitations of liability are independent of any exclusive remedies for breach of warranty set forth in this Agreement. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply.
7. Export.
You acknowledge that the Products are subject to the U.S. export control and sanctions laws (including the Export Administration Regulations) (“Export Controls”) and that You will comply with the Export Controls. You will not export or re-export the Products, directly or indirectly, to, or use or provide (or enable any third party to use) the Products in connection with: (a) any countries that are subject to U.S. export restrictions (including, but not limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), (b) any third party whom You know or have reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or rocket systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle systems, or © any third party who has been prohibited from participating in the U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code § 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
9. Counterparts; Entire Agreement.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together will constitute the same instrument. This Agreement, together with any Exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, and communication, whether written or oral.
10. Governing Law; Venue.
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in California without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. In any action or suit to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement or to interpret any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
